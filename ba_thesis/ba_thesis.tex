\chapter{Populism as ideology of the democracy}
\section{What is an ideology?}
In order to understand the connection between populism and ideology, this section will outline a theoretical framework behind ideologies. There are, in general, several approaches within political theory to define or describe ideologies. For example, one might take policies into account and consider ideologies as attributions of them in a one-dimensional left-right spectrum. Such a policy-based approach can be useful for descriptive analysis of party alignment or voting behavior. \citep[p.~154]{lembcke:2014} But what is an ideology in itself?\par
The concept of attributing policies to ideologies suggests that ideologies are related to political issues and the way we think about politics. They originate from political thought, which is on the other hand expressed by a specific terminology and its meanings. With this, it opens up a discourse-analytical approach to ideologies that is particularly represented through the work of Michael Freeden. He claimed that the ``study of ideology becomes the study of the nature of political thought: its building blocks and the clusters of meaning with which it shapes the political worlds we populate''. \cite[p.~15]{freeden:2006} For him, the act of political thinking arises from real-world contexts and seeks interpretations of the political reality - within a specific terminological framework that is used to express and formulate these meaningful interpretations. Political thought is thus, too, a practice of building meanings and where individuals ``attempt [...] to impose specific senses on repositories of political meaning that are by their semantic nature multivalent and contestable''. \cite[p.~19]{freeden:2006} At this point, ideologies play a central role. They can structure the described process of political thought in the sense that ideologies both assign and fix specific meanings to political ideas or concepts. Freeden understands ideologies further as conceptual structures with which all political actors describe themselves, the relation between them and their relation to the surrounding world. Consequently, ideologies temporarily ``define our understanding of the political'' and they are thus dynamic, i.e. they change as political challenges of the society change. Within this dynamic alignment they also ``compete with alternative configurations over political support and over the central control of the political''. \cite[p.~14]{freeden:2006}\par

\section{Populism: the bridge between \guilsinglright the people\guilsinglleft\ and \guilsinglright the politics\guilsinglleft}
Both left-wing (Mouffe) and right-wing populism construct a version of "the poeple".\\
right-wing populism: aims for a simplification of reality\\
left-wing populism (Mouffe): shall clarify structures of oppression and exploitation
\section{The role of antagonisms}
Antagonisms either help to reduce the whole world or to re-politicize society.\\
right-wing populism: Fight against immigrants, political and economic elites\\
left-wing populism (Mouffe): Fight against poverty, the capital, privileged classes

\chapter{The AfD party and its right-wing populism}
\section{Usage of right-wing antagonisms at the level of the federal states}
The AfD party changed from Euroscepticism to (radical) right. Populist strategies against the government are common, also against immigration (Remigration).\\
Example of antagonistic speech: Telegram messages of the highest reaction rates!\\
Rating of the Verfassungsschutz concerning right-wing extremism is a potential East-West difference. The more extremistic the more concentration on ethnic aspects.\\
With this in mind, one might ask the question of whether the AfD party creates region-dependent populist narratives or a unique overall narrative related to right-wing antagonisms.

\section{Towards an analysis of the programmatic discourse}
Limit the analysis to the four subdicts from RPC. Why are these antagonisms relevant to the question in section 3.1.?\\
How can we achieve regional information on programmatic development? Manifestos are in this sense very helpful because they are created within a democratic process and therefore offer a deeper view inside the party.\\
Is there other current research that uses AfD manifestos? UK comparison, etc...\\
Which manifestos had specifically been chosen for this analysis, and why?
