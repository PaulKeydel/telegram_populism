# Populist right-wing antagonisms within the AfD party
Based on a dictionary (RPC-Lex, Cornelius Puschmann et al.), the project wants to figure out how right-wing antagonisms are distributed within the communication of the AfD party. Considered are their Telegram communication and their programmatic discourse given by manifestos. This repo contains
* the Python script for scraping from Telegram
* the Python script to convert manifestos from pdf to plain text
* the Python script for scraping from websites (right-wing movements)
* the Telegram corpus and the manifesto corpus as *.tsv files
* the R scripts for data analysis, for Telegram and the manifestos
* my BA thesis as LaTeX project
